## Day 8 : Sept 30 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Started Lecture 1 of 18 of Caltech's Machine Learning Course - CS 156 by Professor Yaser Abu-Mostafa. It contained the outline of the course and different components of the learning problem :
                      * Unknown target function
                      * Training Examples
                      * Learning Algorithm
                      * Hypothesis set H = {h} , g E H
                      * Final Hypothesis g
                      
 He also explained the Perceptron Learning Model (H + PLA).
 
 **Noteworthy Question** : What is/are the esssence of ML ?
